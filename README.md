# Software Engineering 

### Introduction
As I progress through my academic and professional journey, I have come to realize that true growth involves not just developing technical proficiency, but also cultivating strong ethical foundations and spiritual maturity. Working in team environments—especially when faced with challenges—has been a significant part of my development. Below, I present experiences that reflect both my professional capabilities and my commitment to personal and spiritual integrity.

### Professional & Spiritual Goals
- Complete my education (Master’s degree) and continue learning throughout life.
- Connect with people across various industries and create systems that work.
- Stay busy and useful in all aspects of life—personally, professionally, and spiritually.

### Technical Skills
**Programming Languages**
  - Java
  - Python
    
**Tools & Methodoloies**
  - Git & GitHub
  - Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
  - Agile / Scrum Methodology
  - Unit Testing (e.g., JUnit, PyTest)

### Projects
**Real Estate Management System**
A console-based system with two modules: Listings and Bids. Users can add, view, or auto-generate property listings and manage bids. Designed for internal use, it supports modular logic and direct console interaction for property and bid tracking.

**Dessert Shop**:
A console-based POS system where users build custom dessert orders (candy, cookies, ice cream, sundaes). Includes features like payment method selection, receipt generation, and customer tracking. Created for small vendors to simulate real-world business flow.

**BlackJack Game**: 
A Java-based Blackjack game with custom GUI, emphasizing object-oriented design and accessibility. Includes keyboard navigation, logic testing, and a color-blind-friendly interface. Developed to reinforce GUI design and inclusive software principles.

### Collaborative Group Work in Multidisciplinary Classes
 **Project Overview**
In two group-based projects, I collaborated on documentation, coding, and presentations. While some teammates struggled with time and  quality, I and others took initiative to uphold standards and meet deadlines.

 **Professional Challenge**
A recurring issue was unequal contribution. In multiple cases, I had to assume additional responsibilities to maintain team integrity and  academic performance. This experience strengthened my resolve to foster accountability, communication, and fairness in group settings

**Project Description:**
In two different classes, I worked on group-based projects that required coordination, research, and timely execution. These projects involved software documentation, coding tasks, and presentation preparation. While the expectations were clear, not all team members met them equally.
**Professional Challenge:**
A recurring issue was unequal contribution—particularly when some members failed to manage their time effectively or deliver quality work. In several instances, I and a few others had to take on responsibilities assigned to someone else in order to meet deadlines and uphold academic standards.

#### Spiritual Integration & Temple Reflection
A recent visit to the temple helped me reflect on my role as a disciple of Jesus Christ in the software engineering field. The quiet and peace of the temple reminded me of the Savior’s servant leadership, which I strive to emulate.
I now view my profession not merely as a job, but as a calling to serve others through empathy, diligence, and humility. In the BlackJack Game, for instance, I implemented accessible UI elements not because they were required, but because they aligned with my values—respect, inclusivity, and compassion.

"Whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men." – Colossians 3:23

### Usability Testing and Portfolio Enhancements
I conducted usability testing with two peers and one faculty mentor. Their feedback emphasized:
Strong personal reflection
Need for clearer structure and visual consistency

**Implemented Feedback:**
 - Added consistent headers and bullet points
 - Reorganized technical sections for clarity
 - Streamlined project descriptions for accessibility by both technical and non-technical readers
These changes mirror the principles I use in software development: clarity, usability, and respect for the end user.

### Reflective Essay: Alignment of My Portfolio with Evolving Goals 
As I reflect on this portfolio, I recognize it as more than a record of achievements—it is a reflection of who I am becoming.
My original goals—education, connection, and usefulness—were grounded in ambition. Now, they are guided by purpose. My Master’s degree was not an endpoint but a foundation. My desire to connect has evolved into a mission to uplift others with honesty and transparency. My drive to stay busy has matured into a commitment to serve with intentionality.

Whether managing team dynamics, building accessible systems, or acting with integrity under pressure, I now see every challenge as an opportunity to grow in character, faith, and skill.

This portfolio is my testimony that Christlike values can and should shape the way we build, collaborate, and lead.

### Mental Map: Christ Like Software Engineer
**Center Node:** Christlike Software Engineer

**Integrity in Code and Collaboration**
- Using GitHub for version control and transparency
- Reporting dishonesty while offering support
- Ensuring fairness in group contributions

**Compassionate User Experience Design**
- Accessibility in UI (BlackJack Game)
- Respecting diverse user needs
- Data privacy considerations in design

**Spiritual Disciplines Fueling Excellence**
- Scripture-guided motivation (Colossians 3:23, D&C 58:27)
- Humility and patience in team settings
- Temple reflection to renew purpose
  
**Technical Growth Rooted in Purpose**
- Real Estate System: Modular design and logical thinking
- Dessert Shop: Usability and interactivity
- Languages/tools: Java, Python, Git as means—not ends—to serve better

### Conclusion
This portfolio represents both who I am and who I am becoming. Through each challenge, each line of code, and each act of leadership, I strive to reflect the values of a disciple of Christ. My technical skills are growing, but more importantly, so is my heart for service, justice, and humility.
I now approach software engineering as a sacred opportunity to bless others—not only through functionality and design but through compassion, ethics, and faith.
